# Wave Equation Simulation

This project simulates the wave equation using finite difference methods. It provides a visual representation of wave propagation in one dimension.

## Installation

If you're using ARM macOS and VS Code, install raylib with:

```bash
brew install raylib
```

then edit the `c_cpp_properties.json` file by adding the homebrew include path. You can simply type on the search bar of the settings `Default: Include Path` and add the path `/opt/homebrew/include` to the list.
